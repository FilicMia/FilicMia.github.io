I presented my work on frequency estimators (such as Count-Min Sketch and HeavyKeeper) in the presence of adversaries, "Compact Frequency Estimators in Adversarial Environments" (by Sam A. Markelon, Mia FiliÄ‡ and Thomas Shrimpton).

Video of the talk can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZzSEvqMmKA).
