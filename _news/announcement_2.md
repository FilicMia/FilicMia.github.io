Together with Kenneth G. Paterson, Anu Unnikrishnan, and Fernando Virdia, we have been exploring probabilistic data structures, such as Bloom and Cuckoo filters. 
The paper summary of our findings titled “Adversarial Correctness and Privacy for Probabilistic Data Structures” has been accepted to ACM CCS 2022.
