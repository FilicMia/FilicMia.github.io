Under the leadership of Kien Tuong Truong, I co-organised the workshop Cryptographic Vulnerabilities and How to Find Them. The workshop was well received, raising the importance of investigating cryptography in "the wild." We hope to organise more such workshops in the future!

More on the summer school and the workshop can be found [here](https://summerschool-croatia.cs.ru.nl/2024).
