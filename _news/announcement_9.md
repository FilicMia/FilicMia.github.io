Together with Anu Unnikrishnan, Keran Kocher, and Ella Kummer, I have been exploring probabilistic data structures with deletions, such as Counting and Cuckoo filters. 
The paper summary of our findings titled “Deletions and Dishonesty: Probabilistic Data Structures in Adversarial Settings” has been accepted to Asiacrypt 2024.
