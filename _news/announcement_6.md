I gave a presentation on Probabilistic Data Structures in Adversarial Settings at the Microsoft Swiss Joint Research Centre (MSJRC) workshop. This presentation showcased my focus over the past 3 years, with two years of her PhD being funded by the centre. The presentation was well-received, sparking interesting discussions and discussions about future research directions.
